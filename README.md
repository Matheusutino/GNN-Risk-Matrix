# How to use

First step is pre process your dataset, in this case an example is present in 'Preprocess data topic'. After this we can use a API present in 'API topic' for generate graphs, calculate results and finally generate a risk matrix. Main example is present in 'Example topic' using pre process and graphs.

# How to compile

With all modules installed, just execute the command:
